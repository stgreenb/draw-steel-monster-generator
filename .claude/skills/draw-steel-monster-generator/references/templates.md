## Advanced Features

### ⚠️ Villain Actions (Leaders and Solos Only)

**Experimental Feature:** Villain Actions are unlikely to generate well through AI. Quality may vary.

Each Leader/Solo has exactly 3 Villain Actions, used once per encounter:

| Action | Purpose | Timing |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Opener** | Relocation, minor damage, summons, buffs, or debuffs | End of any creature's turn |
| **Crowd Control** | Debuffing, area management, regaining upper hand | End of any creature's turn |
| **Ultimate** | High-damage finisher, dramatic finish | End of any creature's turn |

**Template:**
```markdown
<!-- -->
> ☠️ **Villain Action: [Name]**
>
> **Type:** [Opener / Crowd Control / Ultimate]
>
> **Trigger:** You can use this action at the end of any other creature's turn during combat.
>
> **Effect:** [Description]
>
> **Usage:** Once per encounter. No more than one villain action per round.
```

**Example - Solo Dragon:**
```markdown
> ☠️ **Villain Action: Smoke Bomb**
>
> **Type:** Opener
>
> **Effect:** The dragon exhales a cloud of smoke that fills a 5 burst. Creatures in the area are blinded until the end of their next turn.

> ☠️ **Villain Action: Tail Sweep**
>
> **Type:** Crowd Control
>
> **Effect:** The dragon sweeps their tail in a 3 line. Creatures in the area must be on the ground and are pushed 3 squares.

> ☠️ **Villain Action: Devastating Breath**
>
> **Type:** Ultimate
>
> **Effect:** The dragon unleashes their full breath weapon in a 5×10 line. Creatures in the area take damage equal to 2× their tier 3 signature ability damage.
```

### Solo Turn Rules

Solo creatures can take multiple turns per round:

| Solo Type | Turns per Round | Timing |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Standard Solo | 2 | Start and middle, or middle and end |
| Boss Solo | 3 | Start, middle, and end |
| Mini-Boss | 2 | Start and end |

**Template:**
```markdown
<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **Solo Turns**
>
> **Effect:** At the start of each of the solo's turns, they take another turn. This allows the solo to take up to 2 turns per round (or 3 for particularly powerful solos).
>
> **Note:** Only one villain action can be used per round, even with multiple turns.
```

### Minion "With Captain" Trait

Minions gain bonuses when led by a captain:

| Bonus Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Damage | +1 damage |
| Speed | +2 speed |
| Stamina | +5 extra Stamina per minion |
| Accuracy | Edge on attacks |

**Template - In stat block table:**
```
| **+1 bonus to damage**<br/> With Captain | **-**<br/> Weaknesses |
```

**Or as a standalone trait:**
```markdown
<!-- -->
> ⭐️ **With Captain**
>
> **Effect:** While a captain is present, this minion gains +1 bonus to damage.
```

### Malice Features

All monsters have access to basic Malice features:

| Cost | Feature | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| 3 Malice | Brutal Effectiveness | Next ability's potency increased by 1 |
| 5+ Malice | Malicious Strike | Extra damage = highest characteristic, +1 per extra Malice (max 3x) |

**Template:**
```markdown
<!-- -->
> 💀 **[Creature Type] Malice Features**
>
> At the start of any monster's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following:
>
> **Brutal Effectiveness (3 Malice):** The monster's next ability with a potency has that potency increased by 1.
>
> **Malicious Strike (5+ Malice):** The monster's next strike deals extra damage equal to their highest characteristic. +1 damage per additional Malice spent (max 3x).
```

### Triggered Actions by Organization

Based on Bestiary analysis, triggered actions are reserved for more powerful monsters:

| Organization | Level Range | Triggered Actions |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Minion** | Any | None |
| **Horde** | Level 1-3 | None |
| **Platoon** | Level 1-5 | None |
| **Elite** | Level 4+ | 1 (situational) |
| **Leader** | Level 4+ | 1 (ally-focused) |
| **Solo** | Level 5+ | 1-2+ (core mechanics) |

**When to Add Triggered Actions:**
- Elite/Leader with thematic defensive ability
- Solo monsters needing reactive depth
- High-level (5+) monsters

**When to Skip:**
- Minions, Horde, Platoon monsters
- Any monster with 3+ abilities already

**Role-Specific Patterns:**

| Role | Type | Typical Trigger |
|------|------|-----------------|
| **Solo Controller** | Free | Zone/aura response |
| **Solo Brute** | Free | Counter-attack |
| **Elite Defender** | Triggered | Ally protection |

**Example (Level 5 Elite Defender):**
```markdown
> ❗️ **Shield Block**
>
> | **Melee** | **Triggered action** |
> | **📏 Melee 1** | **🎯 Self** |
>
> **Trigger:** An ally within distance is targeted by an enemy's ability.
>
> **Effect:** You become the target of the triggering ability, then can make a free strike against the enemy.
```

**Example (Level 8 Solo Controller):**
```markdown
> ❗️ **Aetheric Backlash**
>
> | **Arcane, Ranged** | **Free triggered action** |
> | **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One creature** |
>
> **Trigger:** A creature within distance uses a triggered action.
>
> **Effect:** The target takes 8 psychic damage and is dazed until the end of their next turn.
```
